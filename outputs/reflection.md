# Reflection Template

- **What changed from Project 1 to this workflow?**
  - This workflow almost exaclty copied the work I did manually from the first iteration of Project 1. It is awesome to see the ease to produce repeatable process that will be able to allow for more beneficial data analysis. The data table and visual output that it created looked different and was structured differently, however that was mostly due to the systems used in the workflow. During the first iteration of Project 1, I produced the comparable table manually and used Gemini to create the visual in Google Sheets. This produced a bit more appealing visual. However, if I was to use python during that iteration to produce the table and visual, like this workflow did, it would almost be identical to the workflow output.

- **Where is the control now?**
  - I believe that I still have control as the 'manager.' However my workload was reduced dramatically using this workflow and using AI. If the output was not what I wanted or if I saw that the AI 'analyst' hallucinated, I have control to edit the prompt or even the code to produce an accurate deliverable.

- **What would you do next if you had one more week?**
  - If I had another week, I could create a process that will create outputs that would dri e accurate action items. I could dive so much deeper into the data to find as much information as possible. Especially using AI and automation functions in GitHub. 

- **Identify one accounting application of this workflow from another class you have taken or are taking. Be specific.**
  - Currently I am also enrolled in ACC 4050 - Financial Statement Analysis. Over the past two weeks we have been applying ratio analysis to financial statements to determine success of a firm. While doing this, the professor asked each student group to choose a publicly traded company to analyze and produce the ratios. After my group chose the company, using Codex and GitHub, I created a workflow that would calculate all of the necessary ratios for our company and it's competitors. All I had to do after I got the workflow operational was upload an Excel spreadsheet containing the financial statements of the company. Then, the workflow would execute a python code to create a new worksheet with the ratios we needed.
